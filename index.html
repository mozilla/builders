						<h2>The Mission.</h2>
						<p>Back in March, we put out our call for ideas to "fix-the-internet". 1500 of you showed up and well over a hundred projects are now underway. Now we're launching our v2: the Mozilla Builders Incubator.
						</p>
						<p>We're looking to invest in people, projects, and technologies that shape the internet and have a positive impact without having to only worry about the bottom line. Firefox, Wikipedia, Wordpress, DuckDuckGo, Kickstarter, GitHub, Node.js, Ethereum are some of our favorite examples of the internet at its best. We’ve done it before. We're going to build 1000 more.</p>
						<p>People like you built Firefox. People like you will write the next amazing chapter of the internet.</p>
