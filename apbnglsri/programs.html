					<p> Determining which program is right for you comes down to how committed you are about your project and how ready you are to develop the project over the long term. All three programs are backed with Mozilla mentorship, are part of our Builder community, and offer weekly cadences & resources.</p>
					<article id="startup-studio" class="">
						<h5 class="faq-article-title">Startup Studio</h5>
						<strong> The Startup Studio is the place to cement the foundation of your startup and initial product traction.</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Almost all programs accepted in the Startup Studio will be (very) early stage startups. This means you have a team and probably have a product or prototype with some users showing initial traction.</li>
							<li>If you’re applying to the Startup Studio, you’re in it for the long haul, not just the 3 months of our Summer Builders. Only apply if you are serious about committing to building a startup and have already spun up an organization (c-corp, llc, b-corp, non-profit, distributed blockchain entity, other).</li>
						</ul>
					</article>
					<article id="mvp-lab" class="">
						<h5 class="faq-article-title">MVP Lab</h5>
						<strong>The MVP Lab is to explore product concepts and, over the 8 weeks of the program, ship a minimum viable product that people want to use (we will measure usage during the program as a sign of viability).</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Perhaps you’re still in school but about to make the jump to the startup life. The MVP Lab may be right for you. During our Spring MVP Lab, most participants were CS students.</li>
							<li>Maybe you work in the industry and would like a structured environment and community to explore and build a high quality product. Some of our favorite programs during the Spring MVP Lab were just-getting-started startups that used the MVP Lab to kick into high gear.</li>
							<li>Most strong MVP Lab applications will be from teams that plan to commit full-time during the 8 weeks of the program. We understand that some teams may not be able to work full-time, but we expect huge passion, high quality work, and a major commitment of time.</li>
						</ul>
					</article>
					<article id="open-lab" class="">
						<h5 class="faq-article-title">Open Lab</h5>
						<strong>The Open Lab is for early exploratory work.</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Participate in the Open Lab to hack on an awesome project in a structured way, create community around your project and, if you want, get it ready for launch or even a company.</li>
							<li>The Open Lab gives teams whose ideas or teams were not yet developed enough for our other programs the opportunity to engage with Mozilla mentors and the Mozilla Builders community to accelerate their product discovery work and grow.</li>
							<li>Successful Open Lab participation requires at least a 10hr/wk commitment.</li>
						</ul>

								Mentors
								<ol type="a">
									<li>All participants will be assigned to one or more of our Mentors who will be available for weekly working sessions at first, every other week thereafter, as your project dictates.
