				<h1>Mozilla’s Fix-The-Internet Spring Lab</h1>
				<p>Whether it’s misinformation, surveillance, shutdowns, or overly centralized platforms, today’s internet has veered from its full potential. Mozilla’s Fix-The-Internet Lab is an incubator-style program to mobilize &amp; fund around products and technologies that enable everyone to connect and build a better society.</p>
				<p><strong>Come build with us</strong>: <strong class="upper"><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScqUVWii7mHswssQCMFhmOWfSSHWaMxqakMdiPEhyxkd8bp_w/viewform">Apply now</a></strong> for our Spring Lab if you want to build an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of your idea this Spring. We are looking for products in the following areas:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="highlight"><strong>Collaboration &amp; society</strong>, particularly in view of recent events: (i) Foster better collaboration online, (ii) Grassroots collaboration around issues &amp; emergencies, (iii) Local &amp; neighborhood support networks, (iv) Supporting small businesses, (v) Social money-pooling for issues, people & businesses.</li>
					<li><strong>Decentralized web:</strong> build a new, decentralized architecture for the internet from infrastructure, communications, media &amp; money using the blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies.</li>
					<li><strong>Messaging &amp; social networking:</strong> can we build a new way to communicate online that favors privacy, people, and users interests? What needs to evolve?</li>
					<li><strong>Misinformation &amp; content:</strong> ideas for apps &amp; services that help us get beyond polarization, filter bubbles and fake news.</li>
					<li><strong>Surveillance capitalism:</strong> whether it’s Big Tech or governments, everyone’s collecting your data. How do we put the user back in control of their data?</li>
					<li><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> put to work to benefit consumers and citizens, not just big tech.</li>
				</ul>
